## Alloy and Corrosion
Alloy and Corrosion are two webproxies made by [TitaniumNetwork-Dev](https://github.com/TitaniumNetwork-Dev).
Alloy is currently no-longer-supported but we keep it around as Corrosion can sometimes be a little unstable (No css for example)

## Contributing
A `.eslintrc.json` is bundled with the source code. Please use it and do not edit the formatting checks. They are there for a reason.
